# Shortest Path Finder

## Description
This project implements Dijkstraâ€™s and Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithms to find the shortest path between two cities. The program reads data from a file named `cities.txt` and constructs the shortest path between a given source city (input from the user) and a destination city (also input from the user). It prints the full path using both algorithms and the total distance for Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm.

## Features
- Load cities: Loads the file and constructs the graph.
- Enter source: Reads the source city.
- Enter destination: Prints the full route of the shortest path including the distance between each two cities and the total shortest cost for both algorithms (Dijkstra and BFS).
- Exit: Prints the information of step 3 to a file called `shortest_distance.txt` and exits the program.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the code.
3. Run the executable file.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to load cities, enter the source and destination cities, and view the shortest path.
5. Choose the 'Exit' option to save the shortest path information to `shortest_distance.txt` and exit the program.

## Files
- `cities.txt`: Contains the data of cities and their connections.
- `shortest_distance.txt`: Stores the shortest path information when the user chooses the 'Exit' option.
